							<h3>Exchange Rate Favors U.S. Skiers Visiting Canada</h3>
							<h4> <em>By Becky Lomax </em>| <em> Posted: Janurary 2, 2015 </em> </h4>
							<p><img class="align-left" alt="skiing" src="../About/images/blog/skiing.gif" width="308" height="206">

								After several years of exchange rates favoring Canadian skiers coming to the United States, the rates have flip-flopped. U.S. skiers can now go to Canada with more favorable exchange rates this winter.
								<br>

								<br>The exchange rate has climbed to the highest it has been in five years for U.S. visitors to Canada. That means U.S. skiers heading north of the border will have dollars with more oomph to pay for lifts, lodging and food. As of Jan. 20, 2015, every U.S. dollar is worth $1.21 in Canada.
								<br>

								<br>Skiers traveling to British Columbia resorts can get a double bonus: take advantage of the exchange rate and explore new elements at several resorts.
								<br>

							<br>Over the past two years, Red Resort has gobbled up more terrain. Last year, Red added a new lift to access 1,000 acres on Grey Mountain. This year, the resort tacked on 200 more acres of pay-by-the-run cat skiing on neighboring Mt. Kirkup.
							<br>

							<br>“We have expanded 40 percent more terrain but not added 40 percent more people,” points out Fran Richards of Red Resort. “We have as much skiable acreage as Breckenridge and Jackson Hole but with one-tenth the skier traffic. We've grown lift and cat serviced terrain by 1,200 acres, but per acre we are less crowded than ever.”
							<br>

							<br>The favorable exchange rate for U.S. travelers just adds to the mix of new terrain and minimal people. “Business from the states has picked up significantly with the new terrain expansion,” says Richards.
							<br>

							<br>Red Resort sits above Rossland less than nine miles from the U.S. border. Because of its location, air travelers can fly within the U.S. to Washington’s Spokane Airport, avoiding higher international rates. From Spokane, rent a car to drive 2.5 hours or catch one of the daily shuttles to reach Red.
							<br>

							<br>The shuttle from the airport to Red Resort also runs seven days per week on the same loop to Whitewater Ski Resort in Nelson. With the exchange rate, you can hit the Whitewater’s Coldsmoke Powder Festival, Feb. 20-22.
							<br>

							<br>To explore resorts further north, axe road tripping by flying into central British Columbia. Most flights from the U.S. route connections through Vancouver, B.C. or Calgary, Alberta, before linking to regional airports, such as Kelowna or Kamloops.
							<br>

							<br>From those airports, you can reach Sun Peaks Resort, which bumped up in size to become Canada’s second largest ski area. The resort added 500 acres this year. Gil’s, a popular backcountry zone on a deep-snow aspect of Mt. Tod, was converted into inbounds terrain. Improved access and egress, glading for more vertical, and a new snow safety program opened the new zone for skiers and riders. In addition, Sun Peaks cut two new steep runs on Mt. Morrisey.
							<br>

							<br>“Skiers and riders have been enjoying some of the deepest turns of the season in the newly opened Gil’s area,” reports Brandi Schier from Tourism Sun Peaks. “Guests from all over the world are blown away by the vast diversity of terrain to discover.”
							<br>

							<br>U.S. skiers can also take advantage of domestic flights and a favorable exchange rate to visit Whistler Blackcomb. Fly into Seattle and rent a car for the five-hour drive to the resort. Or if the thought of driving with a carload of antsy kids sounds more like work than vacation, then fly in to Vancouver, B.C., where you can rent a car for the 90-minute drive or catch the shuttle that connects to Whistler Blackcomb.
							<br>

							<br>Families from the U.S. can use the exchange rate to help out on upgraded children’s programs at Whistler Blackcomb. The new Whistler Kid’s Centre, located in Creekside Village, uses tot-sized furniture for kids ages 3 and 4. For kids learning to snowboard, the Burton Riglet Park can get them sliding through interactive stations that assist in developing balance and movement. At the Children’s Learning Centre on Whistler Mountain, the resort swapped out the old handle tows to install a covered Magic Carpet lift for protection in inclement weather. Parents can also get a bonus during holiday weeks, such as President’s Week and Easter, with Kid’s Night Out evening activity programs for children.
							<br>

							<br>Locate your passport. Time for U.S. skiers to check out resorts north of the border.

							<h3>Hiking Spotlight: The Duffey Lake Road</h3>
							<h4> <em>By Mark Gage</em>| <em> Posted: January 11, 2015 </em> </h4>
							<p><img class="align-right" alt="duffeylake" src="../About/images/blog/duffeylake.gif" width="320" height="213"> 
								
								Located north of Pemberton (which is located north of Whistler) on Highway 99, the Duffey Lake Road is a gateway to some of the most spectacular hiking areas in the Vancouver region. Yes, it’s still a 3+ hour drive from the city, but if you have two or more nights to spare you won’t be sorry you took the trip. Alpine flowers, glacial lakes and 360 degree peak views await you.Here are some highlights: 
								<br>

								<br>
								Probably the most well known of the Duffey Lake Road hikes, the Joffre Lakes trail leads 6km up through forest and across a few rockslides with three beautiful turquoise glacial lakes along the way. The final lake offers backcountry campsites and an outhouse if you wish to spend the night. Although it makes for a long day of driving, Joffre Lakes is commonly done as a daytrip. Dogs are allowed on this trail.
								<br>

								<br>If solitude and exploration are what you’re looking for, plan a trip to Downton Creek. A short hike through sprawling meadows leads to a nice place to camp beside a lake. From there, there are endless opportunities to meander through meadows to smaller lakes, or scramble up the surroundings ridges and peaks. One note, the logging road that leads to the Downton Creek trailhead is quite rough. Consider taking a 4×4 vehicle, or be prepared to walk 3-5km on the road to the trailhead.
								<br>

								<br>A major bonus of the Duffey area is that you can drive to 1300m above sea level, allowing you to enter the high alpine with minimal hiking effort. The hike to Marriott Meadows is a prime example of this. Leave your car on the Cayoosh Forest Service Road (FSR) and enter a true wilderness area in just a few hours of hiking. Lakes, meadows and ridge walks are the highlights of Marriott Meadows. The Wendy Thompson Hut is available to the public for overnight use.
